# A-Path-Finding-Neural-Network
Python project implementing the A* pathfinding algorithm enhanced by classifiers and neural networks. This innovative approach optimized route planning by integrating machine learning to dynamically adapt to changing environments, showcasing the synergy between traditional algorithms and modern AI techniques. It uses pygame and numpy to model a floodfill algorithm similar to micromouse competition.
